          I am an outgoing person who is friendly, I like making new friends who have ideas and l am a critical thinker
          and a great problems solver. Playing football and rugby has been part of me ever since I was a young boy.
          Helping people in the communities is part of my activities, contributing in the communities where 
          people are in need of my services.I enjoy voluntary work for individuals and companies as it allows me to 
          grow and meet new friends who have same interests as me.
